Starting School recruited whole classes and hence includes children who are not part of the core BiB cohort. Starting School Child Info Administrative information about children in the Starting School cohort. Starting School BPVS Starting School was a research project that engaged Bradford primary schools and which ran for two consecutive academic years (2012-13 and 2013-14). The project aimed to assess all children in their first (reception) year of schooling who were in schools where there were at least 10 Born in Bradford children enrolled. Ninety-four out of the 142 primary schools in Bradford were contacted in the recruitment phase. The British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS) is a one-to-one test that assesses a child’s receptive vocabulary. For each question, the assessor says a word and the child responds by selecting a picture from four options that best illustrates the word’s meaning. As no reading is required, BPVS can be used to assess language development in non-readers and especially pupils with expressive language impairments. Because no spoken response is required, the assessment may be administered to pupils with autism and other related communication difficulties or those with English as an Additional Language (EAL). To help with administration to pupils who may be colour blind the illustrations have black outlines and the colours are vivid. Starting School Letter identification Starting School was a research project that engaged Bradford primary schools and which ran for two consecutive academic years (2012-13 and 2013-14). The project aimed to assess all children in their first (reception) year of schooling who were in schools where there were at least 10 Born in Bradford children enrolled. Ninety-four out of the 142 primary schools in Bradford were contacted in the recruitment phase. Starting School CKAT Starting School was a research project that engaged Bradford primary schools and which ran for two consecutive academic years (2012-13 and 2013-14). The project aimed to assess all children in their first (reception) year of schooling who were in schools where there were at least 10 Born in Bradford children enrolled. Ninety-four out of the 142 primary schools in Bradford were contacted in the recruitment phase. Clinical Kinematic Assessment Tool (CKAT) is a standardised, computerised assessment battery of visuo-manual motor control which comprises of tasks involving the presentation of interactive visual stimuli displayed on a touch-screen tablet laptop screen, whilst simultaneously recording participant’s responses to these stimuli via interactions with the screen using a handheld stylus. The battery of tasks presented by CKAT is described in detail in Flatters et al. (2014; PloS One, 9(2), e88692. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0088692), whilst the underlying software architecture and the performance metrics CKAT measures participants on are explained in Culmer, Levesley, Mon-Williams and Williams (2009; Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 184(1), 184–92. doi:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2009.07.025). To briefly summarise: (1) the CKAT Tracking task assesses participants ability to predict target movement; (2) the Aiming task assesses (discrete) feedforward and feedback control mechanisms and (3) the Tracing/Steering assesses (continuous) steering control mechanisms - all of which are considered to be fundamental sensorimotor control processes. Starting School SDQ Starting School was a research project that engaged Bradford primary schools and which ran for two consecutive academic years (2012-13 and 2013-14). The project aimed to assess all children in their first (reception) year of schooling who were in schools where there were at least 10 Born in Bradford children enrolled. Ninety-four out of the 142 primary schools in Bradford were contacted in the recruitment phase. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening tool assessing psychological attributes such as emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer relationships and prosocial behaviour. This version was completed by the child’s class teacher, and also includes an impact supplement, which assesses the teacher’s perceived impact of the difficulties identified.

MeDALL Green Space Questionnaire A questionnaire was developed by Dr Rosie McEachan with colleagues at Staffordshire University (Dr Chris Gidlow) and CREAL (Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, Dr Payam Dadvand) to explore perceptions of quality of local green space, and estimates of time children spend playing in green space in summer and winter months. This questionnaire was approved by Leeds Bradford REC on 31st May 2013 as a substantial amendment (no.3) to the MeDALL (Mechanisms of the Development of ALLergy) study REF: 12/YH/0252, original approval date 12th June 2012. It was administered to English speaking mothers who were attending a MEDALL study appointment when their infants were aged 4-5. Data is available on n=821 mothers. Researchers wishing to use this questionnaire should contact Dr Rosie McEachan (rosie.mceachan@bthft.nhs.uk) in the first instance. MeDALL Neighbourhood Green Space Tool An audit of 45 green spaces in Bradford was conducted in June-July 2015 to examine the present quality of spaces. Spaces were selected on the basis they were visited most frequently by a MEDALL sub-sample. Two assessors completed the audit using an adaptation of Gidlow’s (2012) Neighbourhood Green Space Tool. This tool measures the quality of ‘neighbourhood’ urban green space, including access, recreational facilities, amenities, natural features, incivilities and usage. MeDALL residential NDVI and green space NDVI and local green space based on maternal residential address at time of MeDALL questionnaire.

Usage instructions: This is a long dataset, with many rows per participant, and can be used to identify which property and LSOA the participant lived in at a certain age or time point. This can be linked to property level data (including environmental exposures) using “property_id” and LSOA level data using “LSOA11CD” to obtain property/LSOA level data for specific time periods in a particpants life. Data construction: The source data for this table is address strings from monthly searches of the NHS Tracing service (e.g. health care records), which contain limited geographic information and are temporally irregular. To improve the quality of the geographic data, the address strings are passed through the OS Places API, which attempts to match each address string to a geo-located address, providing additional geographic information.

Temporal variables fixed to the participants age such as age_m are calculated at 6 monthly periods based on date of birth.
